HTML5

### Footnote

The reference .mov file shows inconsistent spacing between navigation links. This has been adjusted in the final file for a more uniform appearance, as the original spacing appeared random and unclear.

Please note that a hamburger menu has not been created, as it falls outside the project scope. Consequently, no responsive styling has been implemented.
